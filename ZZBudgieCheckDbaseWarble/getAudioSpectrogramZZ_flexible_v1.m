% getAudioSpectrogram: Create a spectrogram of an audio signal as an array
% usage:  power = getAudioSpectrogram(audio, samplingRate, flim, 
%                                     tSize, color, clim)
%
% where,
%    power is a 2D or 3D array representing the spectrogram data either as
%       a 2D array, or formatted as a 3D color image.
%    audio is a 1D array representing an audio signal
%    samplingRate is the audio sampling rate in Hz
%    flim is the desired frequency limits for the spectrogram array, in Hz,
%       expressed as a 1x2 array, where flim(1) is the lowest calculated 
%       frequency, and flim(2) is the highest calculated frequency. Default
%       is [50, 7500].
%    tSize is the desired number of time bins for the spectrogram array.
%       Default is the number of audio samples divided by the window size.
%    color is a boolean flag indicating whether or not to output the
%       spectrogram as a 3D color image. Default is false, meaning the
%       output will be a 2D greyscale image.
%    clim is the desired color limits for the spectrogram. Any spectrogram
%       values less than or equal to clim(1) will be set to the first color
%       in the colormap. Any spectrogram values greater than or equal to
%       clim(2) will be set to the last color in the colormap. Intermediate
%       values will be spread across the colormap linearly. Default is
%       [12.5, 28]. Pass in NaN to spread the spectrogram across the entire
%       colormap. This only affects the output if the color argument is 
%       true.
%    
% Generate a spectrogram suitable for audio data.  Based on Aaron 
%    Andalman's electro_gui algorithm that accounts for screen resolution.
%    Use 'showAudioSpectrogram' instead if you just want a display and
%    don't need the array itself.
