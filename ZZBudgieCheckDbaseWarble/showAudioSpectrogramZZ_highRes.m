function showAudioSpectrogramZZ_highRes(audio, samplingRate, ax, flim)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% showAudioSpectrogram: Display a spectrogram of an audio signal as an 
%   array
% usage:  power = showAudioSpectrogram(audio, samplingRate, ax, flim)
%
% where,
%    audio is a 1D array representing an audio signal
%    samplingRate is the audio sampling rate in Hz
%    ax is a handle for an axis. If omitted or empty, the gca() function
%       is used to get or create the active axes.
%    flim is the desired frequency limits for the spectrogram array, in Hz,
%       expressed as a 1x2 array, where flim(1) is the lowest calculated 
%       frequency, and flim(2) is the highest calculated frequency. Default
%       is [50, 7500].
%    
% Display a spectrogram suitable for audio data.  Based on Aaron 
%    Andalman's electro_gui algorithm that accounts for screen resolution.
%    Use 'getAudioSpectrogram' instead if you want the spectrogram as an
%    array or image rather than displaying it.
